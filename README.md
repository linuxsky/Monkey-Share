Monkey-Share
============

A simple file sharing application using sockets written in Python, using PyQT as the GUI.

(This was a final project in an introduction computer science class, so the code is elementary, messy, and should not be used in anything mission-critical)

As this code was a learning experience, I will continue to use it as such, and hopefully others can learn from it as I update the code to be more efficient and usable in future projects.

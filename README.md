Monkey-Share
============

A lightweight P2P file sharing application using sockets written in Python, using PyQT as the GUI.

Originally used to learn about Python sockets.

As this was a learning experience, I will continue to use it as such, and hopefully others can learn from it as I update the code to be more efficient and usable in future projects.
